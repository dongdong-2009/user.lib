This document contains known issues and version changes for the MGI Error Reporter.
Release 1.0.1.24
Save to LabVIEW 2009.  Use VI Server Set Control Value and Run invoke nodes instead of Asynchronous call node.

Release 1.0.1.24
If Error Reporter window is still hidden when Destory is called, close the front panel.  This is because a hidden window will keep a VI in memory even if the VI is not running.


Release 1.0.0.23
Change LabVIEW version from 8.6 to 2011
Add New Row(s).vi to allow child classes to more easily suppress dialog from showing.
Add copyright information to all VIs.
Update Help on VIs.

Release 0.9.0.22
Add MGI Prefix to class VI names
Clean up Palette
Fix problem of not stopping when Destroy is called
Rename "Create" to "MGI Create Logger.vi".  Add "MGI Create.vi" for use with Dialog Reporter

Increase error description length on RT from 256 to 512.
Fix RT behavior of falsely reporting errors.

Release 0.7.0.14
Error Reporter Dialog now stops when LabVIEW is Quit or the project is closed.

Release 0.6.2.11
Better handling for error call chain when the "->" delimiter is used.  VISA errors added to error code to description lookup.

Release 0.6.1.9
Change location of Error Dialog Preferences file from 
"MGI Error Reporter Base.lvclassHandler Wrapper.vi/Error Dialog Settings.vi"
to
"Error Reporter/Error Dialog Settings.ini".
Show Error Dialog as hidden.  This fixes a bug where in later LabVIEW Versions no events would be registered because the Front Panel was not showing.
Add Simple Error Handler to some error wires in Daemon Implementation.vi
